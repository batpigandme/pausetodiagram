### Heads up!

_Pause_. You are about to encounter something which, though not difficult
to grasp, requires that you to focus on it for a hot second, if you've never
encountered it before. An analagous level of difficulty would be learning
how to diagram a sentence. Some people learn this in grade-school, some never
encounter the task at all. It's not _“hard”_ material, and you can be excellent
at sentences (writing, reading—the works), and not have the foggiest clue how 
to diagram one. Basically, it's something that's non-obvious, if new. 

Frankly, sentence diagramming is slightly more confusing, for my money.

Like, you kow how to read this sentence, but do you know how to break it down 
into a sentence diagram? I didn't (hence my adapting it from [Pop Chart Lab's](https://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/210182863/a-diagrammatical-dissertation-on-opening?ref=shop_home_active_23&show_panel=true) super cool first-line-of-novels-sentence-diagram poster).

Here, let's try another:

And here's a seemingly simple one, that's actually a bit trickier than it might 
seem:

Sometimes you're not sure how to read the sentence based on looking at the 
diagram—language is just weird like that:

### Prefix-ify

Here is a very simple example of "prefixifying," if we allow (for the moment) 
that `+` and `sum()` are one and the same.

```{r}
8 + 3

sum(8, 3)
```

Turns out, there's a way to do this for any infix function, even if you don't 
have an equivalent function handy: add backticks ``.

```{r}
`+`(8, 3)
```

OK, let's mix it up a little bit. What if there are two infix operators?

```{r eval = FALSE}
y <- x * 10
```

As Shannon Sharpe might say, _"that ain't no problem!"_

```{r eval = FALSE}
`<-`(y, `*`(x, 10))
```
