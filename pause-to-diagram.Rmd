### Heads up!

_Pause_. You are about to encounter something which, though not difficult
to grasp, requires that you to focus on it for a hot second, if you've never
encountered it before. An analogous level of difficulty would be learning
how to diagram a sentence. Some people learn this in grade-school, some never
encounter the task at all. It's not _“hard”_ material, and you can be excellent
at sentences (writing, reading—the works), and not have the foggiest clue how 
to diagram one. Basically, it's something that's non-obvious, if new. 

Frankly, sentence diagramming is slightly more confusing, for my money. For the 
literate, English-speaking reader, simple sentences are easy to parse (_e.g._ 
subject and predicate; interrogative sentences, direct objects).

But reading is different from knowing the rules that govern such a diagram.

What's more, things get fairly complicated when we examine the types of 
sentences we tend to actually use in real life (you don't need to know how 
to diagram a relative clause or even what one is in order to speak them).

Like, you kow how to read this sentence, but do you know how to break it down 
into a sentence diagram? I didn't (hence my adapting it from [Pop Chart Lab's](https://www.popchartlab.com/) super cool [first-line-of-novels-sentence-diagram poster]((https://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/210182863/a-diagrammatical-dissertation-on-opening?ref=shop_home_active_23&show_panel=true))).

How about the opening line from George Orwell's _1984_?

And here's a seemingly simple one, that's actually a bit trickier than one might
expect:

Sometimes you're not sure how to read the sentence based on looking at the 
diagram—language is just weird like that:

## Back to the AST

### Prefix-ify

Here is a very simple example of "prefixifying," if we allow (for the moment) 
that `+` and `sum()` are one and the same.

```{r}
8 + 3

sum(8, 3)
```

Turns out, there's a way to do this for any infix function, even if you don't 
have an equivalent function handy: add backticks ``.

```{r}
`+`(8, 3)
```

OK, let's mix it up a little bit. What if there are two infix operators?

```{r eval = FALSE}
y <- x * 10
```

As Shannon Sharpe might say, _"that ain't no problem!"_

```{r eval = FALSE}
`<-`(y, `*`(x, 10))
```

OK, so what about **_precedence_**?

The example used in [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/expressions.html#naming-conventions) is actually quite similar to another grammatical favourite: the Oxford comma. 

First, the R example: What does `1 + 2 * 3` yield? Do you get `9` (i.e. `(1 + 2) * 3`), or `7` (i.e. `1 + (2 * 3)`)?

For our sentence diagram, we want to know if we have a compound object (consisting of: rhinoceri, Washington, Lincoln), or if Washington and Lincoln are an appositive noun clause.
